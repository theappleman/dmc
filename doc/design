dmc design
==========

+--------+
| source |   Maildir, mbox, pop3, imap4, mbox
+--------+   (login, ls, exit, cat, head, ...)
    |
 +-------+
 | cache |   Local storage cache
 +-------+   (pull, push)
    |
 +------+
 | tags |   Tagging system pointing to cache contents
 +------+   (set, get, list)
    |
+----------------+
| mail processor |  mail client, user interface
+----------------+  (process mail headers, create mails, filter tags..)

For some accounts we will probably be interested in not caching anything.
This is the case of local maildir and mbox spools.


attachments
===========

Attachments can be extracted from any mail by using the dmc-pack utility.
This tool parses a mail from stdin and extracts the attachments on
separated files in the current directory.


sync
====

The sync process is done independently from the backend.



tags
====

local mailbox is a filesystem cache

filename = unixtimestamp + 2 random letters

Tags are used to mark the mails or files

 $ dmc-tag -s file [tag ...]   # set tags for specific file
 $ dmc-tag -g [tag ...]     # get/grep files matching those AND'd tags
 $ dmc-tag -l               # list all available tags
 $ dmc-tag - < mail         # wtf?
